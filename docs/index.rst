CritiqueBrainz
==============

Hello there! Thanks for your interest in CritiqueBrainz project. In case you
don't know what this project is about, here's more info:

CritiqueBrainz is a repository for Creative Commons licensed music reviews. You
can read what other people have written about an album or write your own review!
CritiqueBrainz is based on data from MusicBrainz - open music encyclopedia.
Everyone - including you - can participate and contribute.

This is an open source project. Source code is available `on GitHub <https://github.com/metabrainz/critiquebrainz>`_.

Documentation is divided into two parts:
1. Information for developers who want to use our web service to get reviews and
do some fun stuff with them.
2. Information for contributors, who want to make CritiqueBrainz a better
project. You can help by writing code, translating the interface, or doing
something else.
